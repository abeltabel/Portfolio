In this project we were tasked to make a portfolio of our coding projects. 

Although not many projects have been completed at the time of typing this, it's something to referece back and update as those other projects get completed. 

We were to use flex box to create seperate nicely spaced boxes that had information corolating to the picture that also adjusted to the device and size of the window displaying the webpage.
